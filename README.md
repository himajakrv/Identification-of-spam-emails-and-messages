# Identification-of-spam-emails-and-messages
For my AI and ML project on identifying and segregating spam messages and emails, I employed various machine learning techniques . The project involved data preprocessing to clean and prepare email data, followed by exploratory data analysis to understand patterns in spam and non-spam messages. I utilized the Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier for model training due to its effectiveness with text data. I incorporated evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall. This hands-on experience with tools like Python, scikit-learn, and natural language processing techniques significantly deepened my understanding of AI and ML applications.
